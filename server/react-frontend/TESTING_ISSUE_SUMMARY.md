# Claude-Test Navigation Timeout Issue Summary

## Issue
The claude-test framework experiences navigation timeouts when testing React SPAs on localhost, even though the application loads successfully.

## Symptoms
- All tests fail with "Navigation timeout of 30000 ms exceeded"
- Error screenshots show the application has loaded correctly
- Tests work fine with static HTML files but fail with React dev server

## Root Cause
The issue appears to be that:
1. React SPAs don't trigger traditional page navigation events that Puppeteer expects
2. The Vite dev server with WebSocket proxy might keep the page in a "loading" state
3. The claude-test framework's navigation logic is incompatible with modern SPA behavior

## Attempted Solutions
1. ✅ Updated test syntax to match claude-test v0.1.0 format
2. ❌ Tried different `waitUntil` strategies (domcontentloaded, networkidle0, load)
3. ❌ Removed redundant navigation actions
4. ❌ Used IP address instead of localhost
5. ❌ Tried tests with and without root URL field
6. ✅ Confirmed framework works with static HTML files

## Workarounds
Since the navigation timeout occurs before any test steps execute, and we've confirmed the page IS loading (from error screenshots), potential workarounds include:

1. **Use Puppeteer directly** instead of claude-test for React SPA testing
2. **Build and serve production version** which might not have the same WebSocket/proxy issues
3. **Create a custom test runner** that bypasses the initial navigation
4. **Use a different testing framework** like Playwright or Cypress

## Test Files Created
Despite the navigation issue, we've created comprehensive test files that would work if the navigation timeout was resolved:
- `00-verify-framework.test.json` - Framework verification
- `watchlist-delete-stock.test.json` - Delete stock with dialog handling
- `watchlist-add-apple.test.json` - Search and add stock
- `watchlist-select-stocks.test.json` - Stock selection and panel updates

## Next Steps
1. Report this issue to the claude-test framework maintainers
2. Consider using Puppeteer directly for testing React SPAs
3. Investigate if production builds have the same issue
4. Look into alternative testing frameworks that better support SPAs
